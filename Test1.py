    ### Quick Start Guide:
    
    1. **Enter your API Key** (if not already configured)
    2. **Select prompt modifiers** from the sidebar to customize how ChatGPT responds
    3. **Choose a GPT model** (3.5 is faster, 4 is smarter)
    4. **Adjust creativity** with the temperature slider
    5. **Type your question** in the text area
    6. **Click Submit** and wait for the response
    
    ### Tips:
    - Combine multiple modifiers for better results
    - Use GPT-4 for complex questions
    - Lower temperature for factual responses
    - Higher temperature for creative tasks
